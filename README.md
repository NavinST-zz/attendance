# Attendance

This application will be used to keep track of attendance for Georgia
Tech College of Computing student organizations and act as a landing
page for them as well.

## Dependencies

To run the app locally, you'll need node, npm (packaged with node >=
0.6), mongodb, 

## Setting up the development environment

First, fork the `gt-webdev/attendance` repository on GitHub, then clone
your fork. For example:

    $ git clone git@github.com:[github username]/attendance.git

replace `[github username]` with your github username.

Then, install all the dependencies and start mongodb:

    $ cd attendance
    $ npm install
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb start  # or the variant for your system

If you encounter an error with bcrypt during `npm install` it's posible that
your openssl doesn't have the config files that are installed with 
`libssl-dev`, installing `libssl-dev` should fix that problem. If you're still
receving errors, try installing `node-gyp` with `sudo npm install -g node-gyp`.


Start the app with:

    $ node app.js

## Code Quality and Documentation

Please maintain well-documented code by providing headers for all named
functions and by placing a comment before each logical section of code
describing what is being done. Pull requests for undocumented code will
not be merged.

All `.js` files should be validated with jslint using the following rules:

    /*jslint browser: true, devel: true, node: true, bitwise: true, 
    continue: true, debug: true, eqeq: true, es5: true, forin: true, 
    newcap: true, nomen: true, plusplus: true, regexp: true,undef: true, 
    sloppy: true, sub: true, vars: true, white: true, on: true, indent: 2 */

For validation, you may either use the [online validator](http://www.jslint.com/)
or use an editor extension such as
[jslint.vim](https://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim/) for Vim.
